# Friday 

![Alt text](frontend/images/fridaybanner.gif?raw=true "Friday Banner")

Group projects can be stressful but they wouldn't be if you're only responsible for your own tasks. Enter Friday, a single page application that helps the user track their group projects. Friday allows the user to enter the e-mail of a supervisor of the group project in addition to the e-mails and tasks of each group member.

### Prerequisites & Installing

First, clone this repo:

```
git clone <link to this repo>
```

Open up `index.html` on Google Chrome for best user experience.

The backend of this single page application runs on a Rails API. Move down to the friday-api directory.

```
cd backend/friday-api
```

Then run:
```
bundle install
```

Run the API with:
```
rails s
```
