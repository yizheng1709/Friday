# Friday 

Group projects can be stressful but they wouldn't be if you're only responsible for your own tasks. Enter Friday, a single page application that helps the user track their group projects. Friday allows the user to enter the e-mail of a supervisor of the group project in addition to the e-mails and tasks of each group member.
